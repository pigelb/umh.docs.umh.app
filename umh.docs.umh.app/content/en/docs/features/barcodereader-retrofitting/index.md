The microservice barcode reader can be used to read barcodes from USB-connected barcode scanner
devices and publish the scanned data to a Kafka topic.

system, such as a warehouse management system or an e-commerce platform.

## What can I do with it?

With the microservice barcode reader, you can integrate barcode scanning into a larger software system using Kafka as a 
message broker. This can allow for seamless data collection and integration, and can greatly improve the efficiency and
accuracy of data collection in various industries.

## How can I use it?

To use the microservice barcode reader, you will need to download and install the Go program, as well as any required 
dependencies. Once installed, you can configure the program to use your USB-connected barcode scanner device and set up
a Kafka producer and topic. The program will continuously scan for barcodes using the device and publish the data to the
Kafka topic.

## What are the limitations?
